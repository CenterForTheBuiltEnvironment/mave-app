In order of time required:
) Test using nans for values in the regressors
) Test files with additional weather data (e.g. wetbulb for chiller efficiency, rain (occupancy impact), etc.)
) Tidy up code, move preprocessing and date processing in new functions/files
) Double check the parameter value ranges for each regressor
) Test with no weather data (use http://open.enernoc.com/data/) - longer term, automate this process.
) Consider weighting more recent data as more important using sampling (for multi year datasets)
) Build an hourweekday bin 'regressor' (as a backup in case the other regressors fail)
