In order of time required:
) Test using nans for some values in the regressors
) Test with additional weather data
) Move preprocessing and date in new functions/files
) Double check the parameter value ranges for each regressor
) Test with no weather data (use http://open.enernoc.com/data/) - longer term, automate this process.
) Consider weighting more recent data as more important using sampling
) Build an hourweekday bin 'regressor' (as a backup in case the other regressors fail)
)
